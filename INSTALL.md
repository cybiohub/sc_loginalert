## INSTALLATION

1. Download files from this repository directly with git or via https.

   ```

2. Unzip the zip file.
   ```bash
  unzip loginalert.zip
   ```

3. Make changes to the install script to configure it to match your environment.

	==You need to customize the following settings:==

5. Deploy the executable of the `loginalert` script.

   ```bash
  cp ./bin/loginalert /usr/bin/
  chown root:root /usr/bin/loginalert
  chmod 500 /usr/bin/loginalert
   ```
		
6. Add the following entry to the files in the pam.d directory. You should do this at a minimum for `sshd`, but we recommend that you also add the line in the `login`, `su` and `sudo` files.

   ```bash
  vim /etc/pam.d/sshd
  vim /etc/pam.d/login
  vim /etc/pam.d/su
  vim /etc/pam.d/sudo
   ```

   and add this line to the end of the last `session` parameters in the file.

   ```bash
  session optional pam_exec.so /usr/bin/loginalert
   ```

## SMTP Client (_optional_)

This section is only intended to help users configure sending emails from their machine. Use whatever method you want, it doesn't matter.

### Send with Exim4

First method is with `Exim4` services.

1. Configure the sending of emails.
   a. For direct sending of emails with Exim4, uses the commande.

   ```bash
   dpkg-reconfigure exim4-config
   ```

   ```
   mail sent by smarthost; no local mail
   System mail name:  example.com
   IP-addresses to listen on for incoming SMTP connections: 127.0.0.1
   Other destinations for which mail is accepted: server.example.com
   Visible domain name for local users: example.com
   IP address or host name of the outgoing smarthost: smtp.example.com
   Keep number of DNS-queries minimal (Dial-on-Demand)? No
   Split configuration into small files? No
   ```

   b. Manual verification.
     Create a message.
   ```bash
   vim mail.txt
   ```

   ```
   This is an email verification email service. Thank you for not replying to this message.
   ```
  
   Send the message.
   ```bash
   cat mail.txt | /usr/bin/mail -s "Email verification" "user@example.com"
   ```

<br>

 ### Config with SSMTP
  
The second method you can use is with the `SSMTP` application. It will allow authenticated sending of email or from a non-commercial connection requiring authentication.

1. Configure the sending of emails.
   a. Install ssmtp package.
   ```bash
   apt-get install ssmtp
   ```

   b. Authenticated sending of email or from a connection that requires authentication with SSMTP.

   ```bash
   vim /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf
   ```

   ```
   root=postmaster
   
   #:25, :465, :587 and :2525
   mailhub=mail.example.com:25
   
   hostname=mail.example.com

   Authuser=username
   AuthPass=password
   UseTLS=YES
   ```

   c. Manual verification.
   
   Create a message.
   ```bash
   vim mail.txt
   ```

   ```
   To: user[[@example.com]]
   From: user[[@example.com]]
   Subject: Email verification
   
   This is an email verification email service. Thank you for not replying to this message.
   ```
  
   Send the message.
   ```bash
   /usr/sbin/ssmtp user@example.com < mail.txt
   ```
